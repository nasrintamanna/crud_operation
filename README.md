# crud_operation

This CRUD operation project is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete data in a database using a web application interface. The MERN app provides a seamless end-to-end solution for managing and manipulating data efficiently.
